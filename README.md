# DSCI 100 Group Project - Predicting Housing Prices - Group Project Proposal
### Group Members: David Chen, Catherine Jiang, Chanon Mallikamas, Christopher Xu

### Introduction 
With the housing market being such a large share of the GDP, changes in the price and consumer outlook on the housing market can sway an economy. Hence, having the tools to accurately predict such a significant aspect of the economy can be highly beneficial. For a specific house, it is important for sellers to determine an adequate price to maximize their profit. 
Additionally, by identifying the price range of a house, it allows buyers to gauge the competitiveness of a house on the market and its long-term value. Therefore, this dataset exhibits valuable information and real-life applications. Using this predictive question, we can take a representative data set for the whole real estate population and infer characteristics of the whole population.

### Question: Can we use the data of past housing prices to predict the price of a new house?
